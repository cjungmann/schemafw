When this directory was created in early April 2017, its
intention was to collect some stylesheet tests.  Other
tests may find their way into the directory in the future.

Run the tests by typing at the command line prompt:

To test the form stylesheet
$ ./test form

To test the table stylesheet
$ ./test table

To test the calendar stylesheet
$ ./test calendar

DON'T add the extension because the test script uses
the name to invoke both the XML file and the XSL stylesheet
to be used for translation.
