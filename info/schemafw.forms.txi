@chapter Forms

Forms are the fundamental interface between the user and the
web application.  A form is a set of labeled fields into which
a user provides information that will be sent as a request to
the web server.

The Schema Framework provides a simple foundation for implementing
forms.  Developers should be aware that the built-in forms are
just the start of what is possible.  There are a few specific form
mode-types (@inforef{Mode Types, Mode Types, schemaserver} for more
information), that have specific purposes, but beyond them, the
developer is free to define custom interactions by using custom
mode types and XSLT templates to interpret them.

@node Form Fundamentals
@section Form Fundamentals

In the Schema Framework, there are two basic types of forms,

@table @strong
@item Context Form
A context form is a dialog display that is spawned from a data
display to view or modify data.  The dialog can be an editing
form for a table line or a subform to change part of a parent
form.

@item Jumping Form
The jumping form is a broad category of forms that request
and act on information from the user.  The most common examples
of jumping forms are user login and registration pages.
@end table

@node Form Types
@section Form Types

There are serveral built-in form types that have special attributes.

@table @strong
@item form-edit

This form type will generate a form with fields populated from
a query result.  Note the two procedure references, the @emph{schema-proc}
reference is the procedure to which the form's contents will be
submitted.  The @emph{procedure} reference is to a response mode
whose query will populate the fields.

@example
person
   type        : form-edit
   schema-proc : App_Person_Update
   procedure   : App_Person_Values
   form-action : ?person_submit
@end example

@item form-new

This form type, be default, generates an empty form.  It is possible
to preset some fields, but that is done with context references
(@pxref{Context References}).

@example
add
   type        : form-new
   schema-proc : App_Person_Add
   form-action : ?add_submit
@end example

@item form-page

This form type should present the form on the main page, not within
a dialog.

In most cases, this form type should be handled by a custom rendering
template, but for development, it may be useful to simply render the
data on the main page.  Unfortunately, as I write this info page,
this feature is currently not quite working, and the form is being
renderered into a dialog on top of the page.

In light of this form type's purpose, it is normally not necessary to
include a schema, so the @emph{schema} instruction is not automatically
generated.  However, for development purposes, where the page serves
as a placeholder for future work, the developer may want to show the
data as a form.  In this case, the @emph{schema} instruction @strong{will}
be necessary in order to let the framework know how to proceed.  The
following example shows how a placehold page might look:

@example
home
   type        : form-page
   procedure   : App_Home_Page
   schema
@end example

@end table


@include schemafw.forms.srm.txi


@node Error Message Query
@section Error Message Query

The established pattern for communicating the outcome of a
procedure is through an @emph{error message query}.  In the
SQL file, it takes the following form:

@example
SELECT 0 AS error, 'Success' AS msg;
@end example

There are two fields in the error message query,

@table @strong
@item error
This is an integer indicating the outcome.  Typically, success
is indicated with an error value of 0, and a failure is non-zero.
While it may seem strange to indicate success with 0, which in
other contexts means @code{false}, the main reason for this is
that failure of a specific action is often the result of one or
more other failures.  With 0 meaning no error, the non-zero
@code{error} value can communicate the cause of the failure.

@item msg
This is a text field that will be presented to the user before
any action is taken.  Use this field to communicate the nature
of an error, if any.

@end table

@node Jumping Form
@section Jumping Form

* Jumping Form Example Login Response Mode::

@end menu

The main characteristic of a jumping form is that an action
follows the submission of the form, and that there are usually
multiple paths that can follow.

An example is a login form.  The result of a login form depends
on whether or not the credentials are accepted.  The default
pattern for communicating these intentions is done with the
@emph{error message query} that follows a main query.

@node Jumping Form Example Login Procedure
@subsection Jumping Form Example Login Procedure

The most straighforward example of a jumping form is
a login form.  In most cases, the user should be sent to
different pages according to whether or not the login
credentials are accepted.

Notice the @emph{error message queries} that follow the
credential-checking query.

@example
CREATE PROCEDURE App_User_Login(handle VARCHAR(20)
                                password VARCHAR(20)
BEGIN
   DECLARE userid INT UNSIGNED;

   SELECT u.id INTO userid
     FROM User u
    WHERE u.handle = handle
      AND u.password = App_Encrypt_Password(password);

  IF userid IS NOT NULL THEN
     App_Prepare_User_Login(userid);
     SELECT 0 AS error, 'Success.', AS msg;
  ELSE
     SELECT 1 AS error, 'Login failed.' AS msg;
  END IF;
END $$
@end example

The next section will show how the various @emph{error}
values are used.

@node Jumping Form Example Login Response Mode
@subsection Jumping Form Example Login Response Mode

Notice the @emph{jumps} section of the following response
mode.  The @emph{jump0} and @emph{jump1} correspond to
the @emph{error} attribute of the result row that was set
with the @emph{error message query} in the App_User_Login
procedure.

@example
login_submit
   type         : form-jump
   session-type : establish
   procedure    : App_User_Login
   result
      type : variables
      jumps
         jump0: main.srm
         jump1: ?login
@end example

In this example, a successful attempt to login will match
the @emph{jump0} instruction, taking the user to the main
page.  A failure matches @emph{jump1} and returns to the
login response mode of the current SRM file.

@node Other Jumping Form Examples
@subsection Other Jumping Form Examples

There are other interactions where different inputs may
dictate a variety of destinations.  For example, a registration
form may fail because if an already-used handle or if the
primary password field differs from the confirmation password
field.  These two errors type suggest sending a different
message for each error type.  In this case, there could be
three @emph{error message queries}, one for success (error=0),
another for a non-unique handle (error=1), and the last for
mismatched passwords (error=2).
