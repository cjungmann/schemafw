# Schema Framework Install Utilities

This directory was created in the interest of making the Schema Framework
easier to use and understand.  It begins with a script for making a
demonstration website with a simple PEOPLE table.  In the beginning,
the `init_site` script will serve both as a quick-and-dirty installer
*and* as a reference to the steps needed for successfully creating a
working Schema Framework site.

There is a [troubleshooting][1] page that attempts
to record solutions to commonly encountered problems.  Some `init_site`
error messages will refer to sections in the [troubleshooting][1].
